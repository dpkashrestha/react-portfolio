# React Portfolio ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description

This project builds a portfolio web page as a single-page application using React library. It hosts my information on the `About Me` page, demonstrates all my work samples in the `Projects` page, gives visitors a way to contact me with the `Contact` form and also provides a way to download my resume on the `Resume` page.

The application is built with single responsibility components laid out on various pages. The navigation is managed with "react-router-dom". I have also used "react-bootstrap" library components to ease the content design.

It is deployed on `Netlify`.
